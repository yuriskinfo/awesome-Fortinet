== Help
Places to get help.

* https://support.fortinet.com Obvious one, if you have support contract for your equipment, the TAC is always available.
* https://community.fortinet.com - Community Forums, many Fortinet TAC folks frequent them and if questions are not being answered moderators (Anthony, Stephen, and Jean-Philippe) 
take upon themselves to route the question to appropriate people. This is not an official support channel though - everything is done on volunteer basis. 
* https://www.reddit.com/r/fortinet/ Reddit, many Fortinet employees hang around there, as well as very knwoledgeable folks in general. 
* https://community.fortinet.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/ct-p/knowledgebase Knowledgebase of example configurations, created and maintained by Fortinet staff. It has very 
powerfull filtering/search capabilities, and is the 1st place to look for examples.
